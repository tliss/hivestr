# hivestr
A location-based chat client

This was a project done for AngelHack 2017. Our team created a messaging service in Android that allows you to talk with
people around you, using GPS-enabled, location-based filtering and Satori's live data API. 

Hivestr was runner-up to the grand prize and won an award for best app to help veterans from Operation Code.
